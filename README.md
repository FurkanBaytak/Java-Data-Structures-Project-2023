## Question 1: B-Tree Sorting Machine

**Files:**
- `Question1.java`

**Description:**
This program sorts an array of key values using a B-Tree. The keys are inserted into the B-Tree, and then the tree is traversed in inorder to obtain the sorted order.

**Usage:**
1. Create an array of integers.
2. Insert the array elements into the B-Tree.
3. Print the sorted array using inorder traversal.

```java
// Example usage
int[] keys = {5, 6, 4, 8, 10, 22, 35, 46, 15, 52};
BTree btree = new BTree();
for (int key : keys) {
    btree.insert(key);
}
btree.inorderTraversal();
```

## Question 2: Dictionary with Hash Table

**Files:**
- `Question2.java`
- `mywords.txt`

**Description:**
This program creates a dictionary of at least 30 words using a hash table where each bucket is a binary search tree. The words and their meanings are read from a file (`mywords.txt`).

**Usage:**
1. Read words and meanings from `mywords.txt`.
2. Insert the words into the hash table.
3. Search for word meanings using the hash table.

```java
// Example usage
HashTable dictionary = new HashTable();
dictionary.readFromFile("mywords.txt");
dictionary.search("computer");
```

## Question 3: Multiple Stacks with Single Array

**Files:**
- `Question3.java`

**Description:**
This program implements multiple stacks using a single array. The stacks support standard stack operations (push, pop, peek) and are distinguished by their stack number.

**Usage:**
1. Initialize the stack array.
2. Push and pop elements from specific stacks.

```java
// Example usage
MultipleStacks stacks = new MultipleStacks(3);
stacks.push('A', 0);
stacks.push('B', 1);
stacks.pop(1);
```

## Question 4: Graph Pathfinding Algorithm

**Files:**
- `Question4.java`

**Description:**
This program finds the shortest path in a graph that connects all vertices together, without any cycles, using the minimum possible total edge weight. The graph is represented as an adjacency list.

**Usage:**
1. Create nodes and edges for the graph.
2. Use the shortest path algorithm to find the minimum path.

```java
// Example usage
Graph graph = new Graph();
Node nodeA = new Node("A");
Node nodeB = new Node("B");
// Add nodes and edges
graph.addEdge(nodeA, nodeB, 12);
graph.calculateShortestPathFromSource(nodeA);
```
